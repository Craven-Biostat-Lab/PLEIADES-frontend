PLEIADES front-end
========================

Here's an angular2 app with the front-end for PLEIADES.

See the back-end readme for more documentation:
https://github.com/Craven-Biostat-Lab/PLEIADES



About the angular app
------------------------
When writing code for the front-end, don't modify the .js files in the 'app' folder!  They are automatically generated from the .ts files with the same names, and they will get overwritten.

Take a look at this quickstart and tutorial to learn about angular2:
https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html

Installation
----------------------
Angular 2 requires node v4.x.x or higher and npm 3.x.x or higher.

Install dependencies with "npm install"


Compilation
-----------------------
When running the back-end in debug mode, the bottle script will automatically compile the front-end for you.

Compile the node app with 'npm run tsc'.  Or, you can set it to watch for changes and automatically recompile by running "npm run start-noserver".
